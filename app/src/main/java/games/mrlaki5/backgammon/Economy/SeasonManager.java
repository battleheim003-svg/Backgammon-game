/**
 * Which season it is, what is still for sale, and what has closed for good.
 *
 * The clock is the device's calendar. This game has no server to ask, so the
 * season is computed from a fixed epoch in six-week steps: every player reaches
 * season two on the same day without a single request, and it keeps working on
 * a phone that has never been online.
 *
 * That has one honest consequence, and it is worth stating rather than hiding:
 * a player who moves their device clock can reach a future season early or step
 * back into a closed one. Guarding against that needs a server, and a server is
 * exactly what this game has chosen not to have. What the clock cannot do is
 * take away something already bought — purchases are recorded on purchase, so a
 * retired item stays owned no matter what the calendar says afterwards.
